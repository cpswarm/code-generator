# CPSwarm Code Generator
The CPSwarm Code Generator is one of the component of the CPSwarm Workbenech and is responsible to translate design-level modelled behaviours into concrete, executable code.
The first version of the Code Generator supports the generation of code starting from the formal description of a Finite State Machine using the SCXML standard.
This project is currently under active development and not ready for production.
